# .dotfiles

Acts as a mini "Home" directory, and automates installing my preset settings for various tools.

## Prerequisites

### Nvim

- gcc-c++
- a Nerd Font (included in the repo)
- dotnet 7 (for c# language server)

`sudo dnf install gcc-c++ dotnet-sdk-7.0 `

## Setup

In a Linux terminal:

` git clone https://github.com/pgattic/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/ && cd ~/.dotfiles && ./setup.sh `

After that, a simple `git commit` and `git pull` synchronize the dotfiles of my machine with these ones.
